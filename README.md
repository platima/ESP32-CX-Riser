# ESP32-CX-Riser
A riser board compatible with ESP32 C2, C3 and C6 MINI modules.

Details at https://www.hackster.io/platimatinkers/esp32-cx-riser-board-c0f530 

Long story short, tiny and designed to be mounted vertically in a PCB much like the Athom plug and many IoT products, but with MUCH more functionality.
